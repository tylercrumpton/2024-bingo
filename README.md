# Crump Bingo 2024

_A cute little HTML+CSS bingo board for things I think would be awesome to accomplish this year!_

**Instead of making a New Year's resolution**, I'm making a bingo card of things I want to do in **2024**. Some of these goals are lofty, some are silly or "trivial", and some just aren't fully in my control.

A **successful result 🎉** for me is that I can look back at the end of the year and celebrate the things I did do, but not feel guilty about the things that didn't happen.

🔎 **_Something fun to note about this page:_** there is zero javascript! The bingo card is made with CSS grid, and the modal card takes advantage of the `:target` CSS pseudo-class. This also means that you can link directly to this info card or to a specific square on the bingo card, like [this](https://crump.space/2024-bingo#modal13)!

🙏 JS-free modal adapted from [@sahil4test](https://codepen.io/sahil4test/pen/xERYvX)
